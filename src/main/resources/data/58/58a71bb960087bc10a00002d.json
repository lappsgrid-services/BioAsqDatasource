        "ULEs are located in intergenic or intronic regions and are depleted from segmental duplications. In addition, here we show that these elements are preferentially found in pathogenic deletions (enrichment ratio 3.6 vs. 0.5 in duplications), and that this association is not related with a higher content of genes.", 
        "we begin by showing that depletion for uces characterizes the most recent large-scale human cnv datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo cnvs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for uces.", 
        "Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are strongly depleted from segmental duplications and copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome, suggesting that deletion or duplication of a UCE can be deleterious to the mammalian cell. These elements are most often located either overlapping exons in genes involved in RNA processing or in introns or nearby genes involved in the regulation of transcription and development.", 
        "Mammalian ultraconserved elements are strongly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Notably, of the UCEs that are found in segmental duplications or copy number variants, the majority overlap exons, indicating, along with other findings presented, that UCEs overlapping exons represent a distinct subset.",
