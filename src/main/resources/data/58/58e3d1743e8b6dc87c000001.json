        "Nucleosomes along viral cccDNA in the minichromosomes are not random but sequence-specifically positioned.", 
        "In vitro assembled minichromosomes were able to replicate efficiently in vitro, when the DNA was preincubated with T-antigen, a cytosolic S100 extract and three deoxynucleoside triphosphates prior to chromatin assembly, indicating that the origin has to be free of nucleosomes for replication initiation. The transcriptionally inactive locus is covered by an array of positioned nucleosomes extending over 1,400 bp. In minichromosomes with a (mu)LCR or DNase I-hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) which actively transcribe the epsilon-globin gene, the nucleosome at the promoter is altered or disrupted while positioning of nucleosomes in the rest of the locus is retained. Viral minichromosomes were found to exist in at least two defined structures covered with 11 or 12 nucleosomes, leaving open gaps accessible for interactions with other host factors. Minichromosomes from both preparations contain the full complement of nucleosomes, but salt treatment removes histone H1 and a fraction of nonhistone chromatin proteins. This double-stranded DNA serves as a template for replication as well as transcription and is assembled into host nucleosomes, yielding circular viral minichromosomes. In contrast, the replicated untreated minichromosomes were found to be densely packed with nucleosomes, indicating that an assembly of new nucleosomes occurred during in vitro replication.", 
        "Several nucleosome-protected sites in a region of the DHBV genome [nucleotides (nt) 2000 to 2700], known to harbor various cis transcription regulatory elements, were consistently identified in all DHBV-positive liver samples. In addition, we observed other nucleosome protection sites in DHBV minichromosomes that may vary among individual ducks, but the pattern of MNase mapping in those regions is transmittable from the adult ducks to the newly infected ducklings.",
