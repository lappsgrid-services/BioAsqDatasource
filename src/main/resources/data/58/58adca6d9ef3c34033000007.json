        "Termination of cryptic unstable transcripts is directed by yeast RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3. These cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. Key substrates for exosomal degradation include aberrant functional RNAs and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). Yeast RNA binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 direct termination of sn/snoRNAs and recently have also been implicated in premature transcription termination of the NRD1 gene. These results suggest that transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome. ",

Key substrates for exosomal degradation include aberrant functional RNAs and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). These cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. These transcripts are targeted for degradation immediately after synthesis by the action of the Nrd1-exosome-TRAMP complexes. Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) were recently described as a principal class of RNA polymerase II transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ", 
        "The exosome and its nuclear specific subunit Rrp6 form a 3'-5' exonuclease complex that regulates diverse aspects of RNA biology including 3' end processing and degradation of a variety of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and unstable transcripts. Known targets of the nuclear exosome include short (<1000 bp) RNAPII transcripts such as small noncoding RNAs (snRNAs), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and some stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs) that are terminated by an Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 (NNS) dependent mechanism. The MTREC complex physically interacts with the nuclear exosome and with various RNA-binding and RNA-processing complexes, coupling RNA processing to the RNA degradation machinery.",
