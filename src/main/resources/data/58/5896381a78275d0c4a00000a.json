        "LINC01089 (LncRNA Inhibiting Metastasis; LIMT) is a highly conserved lncRNA, which is depleted in basal-like and in HER2-positive tumors, and the low expression of which predicts poor patient prognosis. Interestingly, EGF rapidly downregulates LIMT expression by enhancing histone deacetylation at the respective promoter. LIMT inhibits extracellular matrix invasion of mammary cells in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo.", 
        "LIMT is a novel metastasis inhibiting lncRNA suppressed by EGF and downregulated in aggressive breast cancer."
