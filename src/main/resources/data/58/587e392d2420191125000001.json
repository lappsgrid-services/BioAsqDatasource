        "LedPred is an R/bioconductor package to predict regulatory sequences using support vector machines. LedPred is provided as an R/Bioconductor package connected to an online server to avoid installation of non-R software. Due to the heterogeneous CRM feature integration, LedPred excels at the prediction of regulatory sequences in Drosophila and mouse datasets compared with similar SVM-based software."
