Here, we describe a novel Tol2 transposon-based vector for assessing enhancer activity in the zebrafish (Danio rerio). This Zebrafish Enhancer Detector (ZED) vector harbors several key improvements, among them a sensitive and specific minimal promoter chosen for optimal enhancer activity detection, insulator sequences to shield the minimal promoter from position effects, and a positive control for transgenesis. Additionally, we demonstrate that highly conserved noncoding sequences homologous between humans and zebrafish largely with enhancer activity largely retain their tissue-specific enhancer activity during vertebrate evolution. More strikingly, insulator sequences from mouse and chicken, but not conserved in zebrafish, maintain their insulator capacity when tested in this model.",
