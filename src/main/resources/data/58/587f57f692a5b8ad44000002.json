        "Well-developed fractality is revealed for the chromosomal distribution of different classes of CNEs in the human genome by employing the scaling of block entropy and box-counting. This is characteristic of elements that are either extremely conserved between species or are of ancient origin, i.e. conserved between distant organisms across evolution. There are also power-law-like distributions, i.e. linearity in double logarithmic scale, in the inter-CNE distances, a feature which is connected with fractality and self-similarity."
