        "Yes. HRC may play a key role in the regulation of SR Ca cycling through its direct interactions with SERCA2 and triadin, mediating a fine cross talk between SR Ca uptake and release in the heart. A direct binding of HRC (histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding protein) to triadin, the main transmembrane protein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle, seems well supported.", 
        "Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is located in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and binds to triadin (TRN), a protein associated with the ryanodine receptor and thought to be involved in calcium release."
