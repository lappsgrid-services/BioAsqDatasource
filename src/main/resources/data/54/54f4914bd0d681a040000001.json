        "Numerous studies have demonstrated that Generalized anxiety disorder is associated with increased mortality risk in different populations, including veterans and non demented elderly individuals. Anxiety disorders predict greater mortality, particularly when present with other psychiatric disorders. However, one study has found that generalized anxiety disorder was not associated with excess mortality in depressive elderly people."
