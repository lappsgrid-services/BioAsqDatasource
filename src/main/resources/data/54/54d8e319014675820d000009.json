        "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic cardiac disorder characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias induced by physical or emotional stress, in the absence structural heart abnormalities. The phenotype of CPVT is characterized by polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias under stress and it potentially leads to syncope and/or sudden cardiac death (SCD). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a lethal, rare hereditary disease with an estimated prevalence of 1:10\u2009000 and is caused by mutations in proteins controlling Ca(2+) homeostasis. To date, about 189 variants in 5 genes (RYR2, CASQ2, CALM1, TRND, and KCNJ2) have been associated with CPVT pathogenesis.",
