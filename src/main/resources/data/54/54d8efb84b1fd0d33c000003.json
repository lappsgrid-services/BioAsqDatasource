        "In 1992, Brugada and Brugada first described a new entity, which became known as Brugada syndrome, that is associated with a high risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients without structural heart disease. This syndrome is characterized by a distinct electrocardiographic phenotype, type 1 Brugada pattern, consisting of a coved ST-segment elevation (\u22650.2 mV) followed by a negative T wave in more than one right precordial lead. The typical Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) phenotype is often concealed in affected population. Brugada syndrome is a genetically determined familial disease with autosomal dominant transmission and variable penetrance, conferring a predisposition to sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias. Brugada syndrome (BrS)is considered to be a primary inherited channelopathy often involving the inward sodium current and the diagnosis has traditionally required the exclusion of overt structural heart disease. Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited cardiac disease characterized by ST segment elevation in V1-V3 ECG leads. Mutations SCN5A gene encoding for the cardiac voltage-gated Na(+) channel are found in some BrS patients, but also in family members with isolated conduction disturbances."
