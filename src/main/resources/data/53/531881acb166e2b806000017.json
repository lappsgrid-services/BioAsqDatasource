        "Hsp90 inhibition is followed by G1/S cell cycle arrest, downregulation of key signalling proteins such as IGF-IR, Akt, IKK-\u03b1, IKK-\u03b2, FOXO1, ERK1/2 and c-Met, and sequestration-mediated inactivation of NF-\u03baB, resulting in disruption of oncogenic signalling integrity, reduced cell proliferation, decline of cell motility, enhanced apoptotic cell death, and finally, sensitization of cancer cells to additional chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy."
