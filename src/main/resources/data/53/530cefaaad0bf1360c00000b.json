        "Greater h-index is associated with greater academic rank in academic neurosurgery. The h indices increased significantly with increasing academic rank, with the median for instructors, assistant professors, associate professors, and professors was shown to be 2, 5, 10, and 19, respectively. In addition, h-index was shown to be predictive of NIH funding, fellowship training, academic productivity and salary."
