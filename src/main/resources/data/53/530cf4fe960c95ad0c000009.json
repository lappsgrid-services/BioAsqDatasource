        "Tetracycline is incorporated in the teeth during their formation and leads to their permanent staining. A definite relationship between total dosage and staining and duration of administration and staining was established; the condition occurred with greater frequency (in more than one-third of the children) when the total dosage exceeded 3 g. or the duration of treatment was longer than 10 days."
