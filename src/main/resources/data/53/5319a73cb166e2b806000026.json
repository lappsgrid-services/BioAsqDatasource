        "Geldanamycin is an ansamycin antibiotic which holds the ability to bind heat-shock protein 90. This interaction can lead to the disruption of heat-shock protein 90-containing multimolecular complexes. Additionally, it can induce inhibition or even degradation of partner proteins dissociated from the 90 kDa chaperone and, eventually, cause apoptosis in a variety of cell types."

Using the standard inhibitors of the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of Hsp90, geldanamycin (GA) and 17-allylamino-17- demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), novel solid-phase immunoassays have been validated using a time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) end point. Their utility for confirming the mechanism of action of Hsp90 inhibition in secondary cell-based assays has been shown and applied to the novel Hsp90 inhibitor CCT018159.",
