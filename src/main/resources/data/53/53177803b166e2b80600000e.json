        "Yes, somatic mosaicism in Tuberous Sclerosis has been documented with the use of mutation identification, and subsequent linkage analysis in the affected families. In a large family with both parents unaffected, 3 affected children and 5 unaffected siblings, a 4 bp insertion in TSC2 gene was shown to be inherited from the mother."

This mutation would cause a frameshift and premature termination at codon 703. Absence of the mutation in lymphocyte DNA from the parents was consistent with germline mosaicism and this was confirmed by our finding of identical chromosome 16 haplotypes in affected and unaffected siblings, providing unequivocal evidence of two different cell lines in the gametes. Molecular analysis of the TSC2 alleles present in the affected subjects showed that the mutation had been inherited from the mother.",
