        "yes, in cancer patients, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) administration was associated with significant improvement in cancer related fatigue levels as measured by the Visual Analog Scale-Energy, fatigue and vigor subscales of the POMS, and the fatigue subscale of FACIT-F. TRH administration was safe and tolerable in the treatment of cancer-related with a positive impact on quality of life, suggesting the need for further studies investigating TRH for treatment of fatigue in cancer patients."
