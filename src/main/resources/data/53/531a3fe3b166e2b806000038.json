Pregnant women, because of their altered immunity and physiological adaptations, are at higher risk of developing pulmonary complications, especially in the second and third trimesters. Pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, increases the risk of complications and early antiviral treatment is associated with improved outcomes."
