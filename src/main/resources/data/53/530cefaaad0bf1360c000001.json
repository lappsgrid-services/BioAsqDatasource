        "Yes, alemtuzumab (anti-CD52, Campath-1H) is effective for remission induction in patients diagnosed with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Alemtuzumab can be administered in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents or as mono-therapy. Response rate to alemtuzumab is more than 90%. Alemtuzumab therapy is associated with improved survival of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia patients."
