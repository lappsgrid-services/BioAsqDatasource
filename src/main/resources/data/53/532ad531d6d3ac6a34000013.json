        "The variable domains of heavy and light chains of antibodies consist of two \u03b2-sheets. The first one is composed of four strands, A, B, E and D, and the second one is composed of six strands, named A', G, F, C, C' and C''. The antigen binding site is formed by the inter-strand links BC, C\u2032C\u2033 and FG from each domain."

NMR analysis shows that an intermediate with significant proton protection is observed within the dead time of the manual mixing experiments. Subsequently, the folding reaction proceeds via a biphasic reaction and mass spectrometry analyses of the exchange experiments confirm the existence of two parallel pathways. In the presence of cyclophilin, however, the faster of the two phases vanishes (when followed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence), while the slower phase is not significantly enhanced by equimolar cyclophilin",

Subsequently, a proline cis-trans isomerization reaction in the rapidly formed intermediate, producing 'non-native' isomers, competes with the fast formation of native species. Interface formation in a folding intermediate of the scFv fragment is proposed to prevent the back-isomerization of these prolines from being efficiently catalyzed by cyclophilin.",
