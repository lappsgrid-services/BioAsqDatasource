        "The key-protein that when associated with HREs leads to the activation of all of these genes, is identified as\u201cHypoxia Inducible Factor-1\u201d (HIF1). It is a heterodimer composed of two subunits (IIF1a 120kDa and HIF-1b 91-94kDa), both of which belong to the group of \"basic helix-loop-helix\" (bHLH)-Pas proteins. The heterodimer HIF1 and IIF2 increase in the cytoplasm of cells exposed to hypoxia."
