        "It has been reported that moon phases correlate with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured intracranial aneurysms. However, other authors have found no correlation between incidence of aneurysmal SAH, location of the aneurysm, initial clinical presentation, or amount of subarachnoid blood and the lunar cycle."
