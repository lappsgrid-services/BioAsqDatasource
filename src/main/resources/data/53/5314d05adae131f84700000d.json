        "Brain natriuretic peptide concentrations are elevated in patients with traumatic brain during the acute phase and correlate with poor outcomes. In traumatic brain injury patients higher brain natriuretic peptide concentrations are associated with more extensive SAH,  elevated ICP and hyponatremia. Brain natriuretic peptide may play an adaptive role in recovery through augmentation of cerebral blood flow."

Among patients with severe TBI, plasma NT-proBNP concentrations in patients with hyponatremia were statistically higher than those without hyponatremia (p<0.05). In the hyponatremic group, the plasma NT-proBNP increased to a peak of 1001.16 pg/mL\u00b1131.52 pg/mL within 48 hours after injury and maintained at a high level for 3 days. In the normonatremic group, the plasma NT-proBNP reached a peak of 826.43 pg/mL\u00b1337.43 pg/mL on day 5 and quickly decreased thereafter. In addition, we found plasma NT-proBNP concentrations in patients with ICP>15 mm Hg were significantly higher than those in patients with ICP\u226415 mm Hg (p<0.01). ",
