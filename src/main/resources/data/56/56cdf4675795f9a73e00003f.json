Second, AMPK-\u03b1 knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third, overexpression of mutant \u03b1-subunits further substantiated that AMPK regulates SG parameters. Finally, we identified the SG-nucleating protein G3BP1 as an AMPK-\u03b12 binding partner. This interaction is stimulated by stress and notably occurs in SGs",
