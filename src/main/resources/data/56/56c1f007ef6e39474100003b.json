Further analysis demonstrated significant increase in the number of abnormal mitotic figures, as well as a decrease in G2-M cell population. In hamsters with orthotopic pancreatic tumors, TTFields significantly reduced tumor volume accompanied by an increase in the frequency of abnormal mitotic events. TTFields efficacy was enhanced both in vitro and in vivo when combined with chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that TTFields serve as an effective antimitotic treatment in preclinical pancreatic cancer models and have a long term negative effect on cancer cell survival. These results make TTFields an attractive candidate for testing in the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.",
