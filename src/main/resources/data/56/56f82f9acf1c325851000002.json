        "The identification of the essential genes of bacteria and the minimal genome for the free-living cellular life could provide insights into the origin, evolution, and essence of life forms. The field of Synthetic Biology seeks to apply engineering principles to biology in order to produce novel biological systems. One approach to accomplish this goal is the genome-driven cell engineering approach, which searches for functioning minimal genomes in naturally occurring microorganisms, which can then be used as a template for future systems. Currently a prototypical minimal genome has not been discovered."

A synthetic minimal cell will provide an appropriate chassis to integrate functional synthetic parts, devices and systems with functions that cannot generally be found in nature. The design and construction of a functional minimal genome is a key step while building such a cell/chassis since all the cell functions can be traced back to the genome. ",

However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive.",
