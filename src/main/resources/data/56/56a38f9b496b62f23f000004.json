        "Targeted Chromatin Capture (T2C) is an efficient, easy, and affordable with high (restriction fragment) resolution tool to address both genome compartmentalization and chromatin-interaction networks for specific genomic regions at high resolution for both clinical and non-clinical research.", 
        "Significant efforts have recently been put into the investigation of the spatial organization and the chromatin-interaction networks of genomes. T2C provides an unbiased view of the spatial organization of selected loci at superior resolution (single restriction fragment resolution, from 2 to 6 kbp) at much lower costs than Hi-C due to the lower sequencing effort."
