        "Dendritic protein neurogranin is markedly increased in cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease patients.  Neurogranin might reflect the neurodegenerative processes within the brain, indicating a role for neurogranin as a potential novel clinical biomarker for synaptic degeneration in AD.\nNeurogranin is important for synaptic plasticity and memory."
