        "smFISH (Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization) allows for quantitative imaging of single RNA molecules. Multi-color, single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) is particularly useful since it enables analysis of several different transcripts simultaneously. Combining smFISH with immunofluorescent protein detection provides additional information about the association between transcription level, cellular localization, and protein expression in individual cells."
