        "The intrathymic injection of donor spleen cells into antilymphocyte serum (ALS)-treated mice induces significant prolongation of donor skin grafts. To elucidate possible mechanisms involved in the induction of unresponsiveness in ALS-treated mice after intrathymic injection of donor spleen cells, we have analysed the reactivity of lymphoid cells from unresponsive mice in various ways. Here, we show that in the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 G93A (mSOD1) mouse model of ALS, the levels of natural killer T (NKT) cells increased dramatically, and T-cell distribution was altered both in lymphoid organs and in the spinal cord relative to wild-type mice. Therapeutic immunization of mSOD1 mice with a myelin-derived peptide led to CP activation, and was followed by the accumulation of immunoregulatory cells, including IL-10-producing monocyte-derived macrophages and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, and elevation of the neurotrophic factors IGF-1 and GDNF in the diseased spinal cord parenchyma.",
