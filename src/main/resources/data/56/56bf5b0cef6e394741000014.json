        "Several studies have shown that music can boost cognitive functions in patients with a disorder of consciousness but it is difficult to conclude since they did not use quantified measures and a control condition/group. Active improvised music therapy may offer an adjuvant form of treatment in the early rehabilitation of severe brain-injured patients."
