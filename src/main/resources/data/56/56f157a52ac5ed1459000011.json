        "Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi). This discovery tool is is used for genetic screening based on loss-of-function phenotypes.", 
        "The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats interference (CRISPRi) system is used for targeted silencing of transcription in different types of cells. The CRISPRi system is derived from the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR pathway, requiring only the coexpression of a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein and a customizable single guide RNA (sgRNA). The Cas9-sgRNA complex binds to DNA elements complementary to the sgRNA and causes a steric block that halts transcript elongation by RNA polymerase, resulting in the repression of the target gene. CRISPRi provides a simplified approach for rapid gene repression within 1-2 weeks. The method can also be adapted for high-throughput interrogation of genome-wide gene functions and genetic interactions, thus providing a complementary approach to RNA interference, which can be used in a wider variety of organisms."
