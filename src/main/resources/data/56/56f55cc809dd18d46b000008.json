        "One of the promising approaches to cure diabetes is to use induced PCSs (iPSCs) and to differentiate them into insulin-secreting \u03b2 cells. The induction of iPSC differentiation into insulin-secreting cells can be achieved in several ways, such as with the use of microRNAs, or adenoviral transfection with selected genes."
