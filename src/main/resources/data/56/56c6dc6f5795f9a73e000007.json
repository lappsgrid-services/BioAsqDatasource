        "Nuclear VapB methyltransferase diminishes the establishment of facultative heterochromatin by decreasing histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). Dramatic changes in exposure of a repressive chromatin mark, H3K9me2, indicate that during development linker histone plays a role in establishing the facultative heterochromatin territory and architecture in the nucleus. Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 is associated with constitutive and facultative heterochromatin."

Strikingly, we found that trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), which was previously identified as a hallmark of actively transcribed regions, is deposited onto the silenced, maternally contributed 3-Mb imprinted region",
