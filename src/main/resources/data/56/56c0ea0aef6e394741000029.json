        "Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size from tens of kilobases to many megabases. Coupled with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a bioinformatic platform, this technology could be extended to any organism whose genome has been sequenced. The oligonucleotide probes are renewable, highly efficient, and able to robustly label chromosomes in cell culture, fixed tissues, and metaphase spreads. The method gives researchers precise control over the sequences they target and allows for single and multicolor imaging of chromosomal regions. It is anticipated that this technology will lead to an enhanced ability to visualize interphase and metaphase chromosomes."
