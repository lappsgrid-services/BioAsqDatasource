        "Yes. Many lncRNAs are adipose-enriched, strongly induced during adipogenesis, and bound at their promoters by key transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 (CEBP\u03b1). RNAi-mediated loss of function screens identified functional lncRNAs with varying impact on adipogenesis. Collectively, numerous lncRNAs are functionally required for proper adipogenesis."
