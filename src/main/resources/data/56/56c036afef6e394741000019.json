        "Erucism is defined as urtication by Lepidoptera larvae. It is a skin reaction to envenomation from certain poisonous caterpillar bristles. The hair on the dorsum of the last instar larvae of the moth may cause urticarial reactions (erucism) as well as eye problems and temporary blindness."
