        "A new DNA sensor using a nickel(II) phenanthroline complex ([Ni(phen)(2)PHPIP]\u00b72ClO(4)) as the electrochemical probe was developed. The calculated dynamics parameters of the electrode process indicate that there are obvious interactions between the probe and the ctDNA in aqueous solution. Under constant potential conditions, the redox current peak of the probe (Ni-complex) decreases obviously as the probe interacts/binds with ctDNAs. These results demonstrate that the sensor can simultaneously detect the hot-spot mutation and epigenetic changes on the ctDNA."
