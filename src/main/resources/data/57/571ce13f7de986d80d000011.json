Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that gasdermins are expressed specifically in cells at advanced stages of differentiation in the upper epidermis, the differentiating inner root sheath and hair shaft and in the most mature sebocytes of the sebaceous gland and preputial, meibomium, ceruminous gland, and anal glands. This expression pattern suggests a role for gasdermins in differentiation of the epidermis and its appendages.",
