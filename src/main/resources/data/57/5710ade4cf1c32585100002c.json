        "The activity of TLC G-65 (a liposomal gentamicin preparation), alone and in combination with rifapentine, clarithromycin, clofazimine and ethambutol, was evaluated in the beige mouse (C57BL/6J--bgj/bgj) model of disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection. TLC G-65 in combination with rifapentine appears to be an attractive regimen for the treatment of infections caused by bacteria in the M. avium complex. Rifampin 10 mg/kg daily, ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily, clofazimine 100 mg every day, and ethambutol 15 mg/kg orally daily for 24 weeks, with or without amikacin 10 mg/kg intravenously or intramuscularly 5 days weekly for the first 4 weeks. In vivo phage treatment may also be used in some cases.",
