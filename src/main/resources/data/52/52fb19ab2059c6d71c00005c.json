        "There is increased obstetrical and neonatal morbidity. Women with RA had an increased risk of LBW, SGA babies, preeclampsia and CS compared with unaffected women.\nWomen with  RA appear to have a higher age-adjusted risk of adverse outcomes of pregnancy and longer hospital stays than do pregnant women in the general population, and careful antenatal monitoring should be performed.Patients with rheumatic disease can have successful pregnancy outcomes, particularly when a collaborative approach between the rheumatologist and obstetrician is applied.\nIn general, active inflammation from rheumatic diseases poses a stronger threat to the well-being of both mother and foetus than many immunosuppressant medications. Therefore, continued immunosuppression with the least risky medications will allow for the most optimal pregnancy outcomes."

Compared with other infants, those with mothers with JIA were more likely to be born prematurely, but were not at increased risk of being small for gestational age, requiring neonatal intensive care, having a low Apgar score at 5 min or severe neonatal morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Infants of women with JIA did not have an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. Intensive obstetric care might be required during pregnancy for women with JIA given the increased risk of maternal morbidity.",
