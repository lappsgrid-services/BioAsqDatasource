        "Bladder cancer is any of several types of malignancy arising from the epithelial lining of the urinary bladder. Rarely the bladder is involved by non-epithelial cancers, such as lymphoma or sarcoma. It is a disease in which abnormal cells multiply without control in the bladder.The bladder is a hollow, muscular organ that stores urine; it is located in the pelvis. The most common type of bladder cancer recapitulates the normal histology of the urothelium and is known as transitional cell carcinoma or more properly urothelial cell carcinoma. It is estimated that there are 383,000 cases of bladder cancer worldwide", 
        "Yes, there are. Urine biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis range from voided urine cytology and the UroVysion\u00ae cytogenetic test, to fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), ImmunoCyt, NMP22, Bladder Tumor Antigen, BLCA-1, BLCA-4, hyaluronic acid, hyaluronidase, Lewis X antigen, microsatellite analysis, Quanticyt, soluble Fas, Survivin, telomerase, IL-8, MMP-9 and 10, PAI-1, VEGF, ANG, CA9 and APOE."

Diagnostic performance of each biomarker and multivariate models were compared using receiver operating characteristic curves and the chi-square test. An 8-biomarker model achieved the most accurate BCa diagnosis (sensitivity 92%, specificity 97%), but a combination of 3 of the 8 biomarkers (IL-8, VEGF, and APOE) was also highly accurate (sensitivity 90%, specificity 97%). For comparison, the commercial BTA-Trak ELISA test achieved a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 83%, and voided urine cytology detected only 33% of BCa cases in the same cohort. These data show that a multivariate urine-based assay can markedly improve the accuracy of non-invasive BCa detection",
