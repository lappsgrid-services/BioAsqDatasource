        "Etoposide (VP-16) and Teniposide (VM-26) are effective as an anti-tumour drug by inhibiting eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II via establishing a covalent complex with DNA. Doxorubicin, Daunorubicin and Aclarubicin are anthracyclins that act as DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors and may be used in combination. Benzoxazoles, benzimidazoles and related fused heterocyclic compounds, which exhibited significant eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II inhibitory activity. F14512 is a polyamine-containing epipodophyllotoxin derivative that acts as an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II. Bisdioxopiperazine drugs such as ICRF-187 are catalytic inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II. \nAmong topoisomerase II inhibitors, the cytostatic potency was by decreasing order: mitoxantrone; doxorubicin, which was slightly greater than DuP 941, azatoxin; DuP 937; and amsacrine, which was much greater than VP-16"
