        "Pyridostigmine and neostygmine are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that are used as first-line therapy for symptomatic treatment of myasthenia gravis. Pyridostigmine is the most widely used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Extended release pyridotsygmine and novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitors inhibitors with oral antisense oligonucleotides are being studied."
