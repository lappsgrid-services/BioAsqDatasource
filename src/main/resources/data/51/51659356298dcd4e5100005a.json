        "Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are responsible for the site-specific addition of covalent modifications on the histone tails, which serve as markers for the recruitment of chromatin organization complexes. There are two major types of HMTs: histone-lysine N-Methyltransferases and histone-arginine N-methyltransferases. The former methylate specific lysine (K) residues such as 4, 9, 27, 36, and 79 on histone H3 and residue 20 on histone H4. The latter methylate arginine (R) residues such as 2, 8, 17, and 26 on histone H3 and residue 3 on histone H4. Depending on what residue is modified and the degree of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation), lysine methylation of histones is linked to either transcriptionally active or silent chromatin."
