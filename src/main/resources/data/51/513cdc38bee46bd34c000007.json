        "Thrombophilia has been found to be considerably more common in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In particular there is an increased risk of pregnancy-related venous thrombosis in carriers of severe inherited thrombophilia. When counseling white women with a history of preeclampsia, screening for thrombophilia can be useful for preconceptional counseling and pregnancy management."
