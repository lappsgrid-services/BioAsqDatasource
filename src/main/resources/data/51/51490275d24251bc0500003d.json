        "Yes, nimodipine is recommended and FDA approved for prevention of vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Multiple studies have demonstrated that nimodipine (administered orally or intravenously) is safe and effective for prevention of vasospasm, and reduce frequency of ischemic complications, lowered mortality and improved overall outcomes. Other preventive medication can be also effective for vasomotor prevention in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients."
