        "There is a growing recognition for the profound role of G-quadruplexes in a wide spectrum of diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were recently shown to be caused by expansion of a (GGGGCC)n/(GGCCCC)n repeat in the C9ORF72 gene.  Treatment with a G-quadruplex interactive ligand was shown to achieve antifibrotic action. G-quadruplex forming sequences have also been linked with ADAM10 a primary candidate for anti-amyloidogenic activity in Alzheimer's. A G-quadruplex-interactive agent, telomestatin (SOT-095), induces telomere shortening with apoptosis and enhances chemosensitivity in acute myeloid leukemia."

Recent studies have shown that relaxin prevents and reverses cardiac fibrosis. Endogenous expression of relaxin was elevated in the setting of heart disease; the extent of such up-regulation, however, is insufficient to exert compensatory actions, and the mechanism regulating relaxin expression is poorly defined. In the rat relaxin-1 (RLN1, Chr1) gene promoter region we found presence of repeated guanine (G)-rich sequences, which allowed formation and stabilization of G-quadruplexes with the addition of a G-quadruplex interactive ligand berberine.",
