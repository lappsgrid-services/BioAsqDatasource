        "Anhedonia is associated with poor prognosis in patients with coronary disease. Namely, in patients with coronary disease, anhedonia was associated with increased mortality, greater risk for major cardiac event, impaired physical health status, more cardiac symptoms, more feelings of disability. These associations were independent from clinical and demographic factors."
