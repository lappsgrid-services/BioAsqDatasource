        "Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a 33 kDa single chain glycoprotein belonging to the kallikrein family of serine proteases which is produced by epithelial cells of both normal and malignant prostate tissue. PSA is an important marker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. PSA is also known as human kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (hK3).",
