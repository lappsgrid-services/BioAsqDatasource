        "The EWS/FLI translocation product is the causative oncogene in Ewing sarcoma and acts as an aberrant transcription factor. EWS/FLI dysregulates gene expression during tumorigenesis by abnormally activating or repressing genes. The expression levels of a significant number of genes are affected in Ewing sarcoma, some of which are known to be directly or indirectly regulated by EWS/FLI. Such genes are BCL11B, NRoB1, GSTM4, NKX2.2 and p53."
