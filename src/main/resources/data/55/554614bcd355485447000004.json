        "The d-tubocurarine is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent (nondepolarizing muscle relaxant - NDMR). The nondepolarizing muscle relaxants act by blocking the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular blocking action of tubocurarine is reversible and concentration-dependent. The inhibition of acetylcholine-induced currents by d-tubocurarine can be reversed by anticholinesterase agents, such as edrophonium and methamidophos."
