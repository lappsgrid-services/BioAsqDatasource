        "About 30% of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) cases are syndromic. Hitherto, the disease causing gene has been identified for eight Mendelian syndromes with HSCR: congenital central hypoventilation (CCHS), Mowat-Wilson (MWS), Bardet-Biedl (BBS), Shah-Waardenburg (WS4), cartilage-hair-hypoplasia (CHH), Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO), Goldberg-Sprintzsen (GSS), and hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of the aqueduct of sylvius (HSAS).", 
        "In CCHS patients, the weak predisposing haplotype of the RET gene can be regarded as a quantitative trait, being a risk factor for the HSCR phenotype, while in MWS, for which the HSCR penetrance is high, the role of the RET predisposing haplotype is not significant."

            "text": "Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a fairly frequent cause of intestinal obstruction in children. It is characterized as a sex-linked heterogonous disorder with variable severity and incomplete penetrance giving rise to a variable pattern of inheritance. Although Hirschsprung's disease occurs as an isolated phenotype in at least 70% of cases, it is not infrequently associated with a number of congenital abnormalities and associated syndromes, demonstrating a spectrum of congenital anomalies. Certain of these syndromic phenotypes have been linked to distinct genetic sites, indicating underlying genetic associations of the disease and probable gene-gene interaction, in its pathogenesis. These associations with HSCR include Down's syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies, Waardenburg syndrome and other Dominant sensorineural deafness, the Congenital Central Hypoventilation and Mowat-Wilson and other brain-related syndromes, as well as the MEN2 and other tumour associations",
