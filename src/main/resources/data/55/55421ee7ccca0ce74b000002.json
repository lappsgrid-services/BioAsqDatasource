It plays a crucial role in regulating the transcription of numerous genes responsible for cells cycle arrest, DNA repair, angiogenesis, cell senescence, or apoptosis in response to various stress signals, and is considered one of the most important players in the development of cancer. p53 contributes to the maintenance of genomic stability.
