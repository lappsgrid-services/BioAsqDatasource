        "Greater NT-proBNP serum concentration is associated with poorer cognitive function and cognitive decline. In community-dwelling older adults, greater NT-proBNP levels were strongly associated with poor cognitive function independently from age, sex, education, hypertension, body mass index, exercise, alcohol use, smoking, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, creatinine clearance, and previous cardiovascular disease. However, other authors did not find an association between NT-proBNP and severe cognitive impairment (SCI)."

Associations persisted when pre-morbid ability was adjusted for, but as expected were no longer statistically significant following the adjustment for diabetes-related and vascular co-variates (\u03b2 -0.02, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.03, p>0.05 for 'g'; \u03b2 0.03, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.07, p>0.05 for depression scores). CONCLUSION: Raised plasma NT-proBNP was weakly but statistically significantly associated with poorer cognitive function and depression. The prospective phases of the ET2DS will help determine whether or not NT-proBNP can be considered a risk marker for subsequent cognitive impairment and incident depression and whether it provides additional information over and above traditional risk factors for these conditions.",
