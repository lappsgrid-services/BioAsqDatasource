Triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals.\nEmerging research into a syndrome known as nonceliac gluten sensitivity suggests a heterogeneous condition with some features of celiac disease but often categorized as FGIDs, including IBS.",

With an incidence of about 1% of the general population, it is considered the most common food intolerance disorder.Emerging research into a syndrome known as nonceliac gluten sensitivity suggests a heterogeneous condition with some features of celiac disease but often categorized as FGIDs, including IBS."
