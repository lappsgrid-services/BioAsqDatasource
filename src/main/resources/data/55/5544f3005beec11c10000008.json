        "Spontaneous point mutation rate in a gene increases with its transcription level, suggesting that movement of RNA polymerase through the target initiates a mutagenic process(es). This phenomenon is termed transcription-associated mutation (TAM). Transcription-associated mutagenesis is directly proportional to the level of gene expression."
