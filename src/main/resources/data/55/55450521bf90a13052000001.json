        "EMD increased the osteogenic potential of hDPCs. The expression levels of osteogenesis-related genes, such as ALP, DSPP, BMP, and OPN were also upregulated. In addition, the expression levels of odontogenesis-related transcription factors Osterix and Runx2 were upregulated. Proliferated pulp tissue partly filled the space initially occupied by EMDgel and isolated masses within the proliferated pulp tissue."

One study reported Ca(OH)2 to be more efficient for DPC than EMD. One study reported no difference in the efficacies between EMD and Ca(OH)2 for DPC. All animal studies reported EMD to be more effective in reparative dentine formation in comparison with Ca(OH)2 . EMD can provide favourable results in DPC procedures",
