        "Yes. Interestingly, human ultraconserved elements (UCEs) have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications and benign copy number variants (CNVs). These elements may be interpreted as hallmarks for dose-sensitive genes, particularly for those genes whose gain or loss may be directly implied in neurodevelopmental disorders. Therefore, their presence in genomic imbalances of unknown effect might be suggestive of a clinically relevant condition"
