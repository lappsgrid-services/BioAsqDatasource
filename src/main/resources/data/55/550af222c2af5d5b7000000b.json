The F-box component of this E3, \u03b2-TrCP, recognizes the I\u03baB degron formed following phosphorylation by IKK and thus couples I\u03baB phosphorylation to ubiquitination. SCF(\u03b2-TrCP) -mediated I\u03baB ubiquitination and degradation is a very efficient process, often resulting in complete degradation of the key inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 within a few minutes of cell stimulation. In vivo ablation of \u03b2-TrCP results in accumulation of all the I\u03baBs and complete NF-\u03baB inhibition. ",

CRD-BP binds to the coding region of betaTrCP1 mRNA. Overexpression of CRD-BP stabilizes betaTrCP1 mRNA and elevates betaTrCP1 levels (both in cells and in vivo), resulting in the activation of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF)(betaTrCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase and in accelerated turnover of its substrates including IkappaB and beta-catenin.",

            "text": " The multisubunit IkappaB kinase (IKK) responsible for inducible IkappaB phosphorylation is the point of convergence for most NF-kappaB-activating stimuli. IKK contains two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, both of which are able to correctly phosphorylate IkappaB. Gene knockout studies have shed light on the very different physiological functions of IKKalpha and IKKbeta. After phosphorylation, the IKK phosphoacceptor sites on IkappaB serve as an essential part of a specific recognition site for E3RS(IkappaB/beta-TrCP), an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby explaining how IKK controls IkappaB ubiquitination and degradation.
