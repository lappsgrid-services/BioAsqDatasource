        "Titin, is definitely the largest protein in the body, with a molecular weight of 3 million Dalton and composed of 27,000 amino acids. Titin is the largest protein known to date and acts as a mechanosensor that regulates muscle protein expression in a sarcomere strain-dependent fashion.", 
        "Yes. Titin, the largest protein in the human body, is well known as a molecular spring in muscle cells and scaffold protein aiding myofibrillar assembly. Titin is recently known as the largest protein which exists in the striated muscle sarcomere and is dynamic both in biomechanics properties and biochemical functions.",
