        "The dental follicle (DF) consists of progenitor cells that give rise to the cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone.  Dental follicle cells attach to Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS), and pulp cells in the cementum promoting cementogenesis. The  temporospatial regulation of Wnt/\u00df-catenin signaling plays critical roles in the differentiation of odontoblasts and cementoblasts.", 
        "Our results indicate that persistent stabilization of \u00df-catenin in the dental mesenchyme leads to premature differentiation of odontoblasts and differentiation of cementoblasts, and induces excessive dentin and cementum formation in vivo. It is known that the dental follicle (DF) consists of progenitor cells that give rise to the cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone. Wnt/\u00df-catenin signaling plays an important role in morphogenesis and cellular differentiation during development. New vital tissues can be regenerated in permanent canine teeth after pulpectomy and enlargement of the apical foramen. Constitutive stabilization of \u00df-catenin in the dental mesenchyme leads to excessive dentin and cementum formation. These results suggest that temporospatial regulation of Wnt/\u00df-catenin signaling plays critical roles in the differentiation of odontoblasts and cementoblasts, and that inhibition of Wnt/\u00df-catenin signaling may be important for the formation of dentin and cementum during tooth development. HERS cells played a role in the induction and maturation of cementum-like tissues formed by DF cells. Essential roles of Wnt/\u00df-catenin signaling in tooth morphogenesis have been well known. "
