        "Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The proposed treatment for CCSVI is percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, also known as the 'liberation procedure', which is claimed to improve the blood flow in the brain, thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of MS. There have been reports to suggest that venous angioplasty in MS patients is a feasible and safe procedure and is associated with improved disease symptom severity, quality of life, and corrects blood pressure deviation, improves CSF dynamics. Open venous reconstruction of the internal jugular vein has also been tried with good results.\nHowever, some authors have failed to document beneficial value of venous angioplasty in MS patients and systematic review has suggested that there is currently no high level evidence to support or refute the efficacy or safety of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for treatment of CCSVI in people with MS."
