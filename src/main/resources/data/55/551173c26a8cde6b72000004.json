        "Using acetyl-specific K516 antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. We propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent functions of S6K1 in response to growth factor signalling. Following mitogen stimulation, S6Ks interact with the p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferases. S6Ks can be acetylated by p300 and PCAF in vitro and S6K acetylation is detected in cells expressing p300",
