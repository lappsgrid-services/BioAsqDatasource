        "Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the self-amplifying nature of this derailed interactionIn areas with severe selenium deficiency higher incidence of thyroiditis has been reported due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells", 
        "The essential trace element selenium was recently recognized as being incorporated as selenocysteine in all three deiodinases of the thyroid gland. This has decisively confirmed the clear-cut link between selenium and thyroid function. Additionally, it has been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue, and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of autoimmune thyroid disease.",
